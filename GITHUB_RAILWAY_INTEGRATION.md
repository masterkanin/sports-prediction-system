# GitHub-Railway Integration Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up continuous deployment from GitHub to Railway for the Enhanced Sports Prediction System.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Railway account
- Git installed on your local machine

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "sports-prediction-system")
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Choose "Public" or "Private" visibility
6. Check "Initialize this repository with a README"
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sports-prediction-system.git
cd sports-prediction-system
```

## Step 3: Add Project Files to the Repository

1. Copy all files from the enhanced sports prediction system to your local repository:

```bash
# Assuming the enhanced_sports_prediction directory is in the same parent directory
cp -r ../enhanced_sports_prediction/* .
```

2. Make sure the following Railway configuration files are included:
   - Procfile
   - railway.json
   - requirements.txt
   - database/railway_db_config.py
   - web_interface/railway_app.py

3. Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:

```bash
# Create .gitignore file
cat > .gitignore << EOL
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.env
.venv
env/
venv/
ENV/
.idea/
.vscode/
*.log
*.sqlite
EOL
```

4. Commit and push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Enhanced Sports Prediction System"
git push origin main
```

## Step 4: Connect Railway to Your GitHub Repository

1. Log in to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. If this is your first time, you'll need to authorize Railway to access your GitHub account
5. Choose your "sports-prediction-system" repository from the list
6. Railway will automatically detect the Procfile and railway.json configuration
7. Click "Deploy" to start the initial deployment

## Step 5: Set Up the PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click "New Service"
2. Select "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
3. Wait for the database to be provisioned
4. Railway will automatically link this database to your application by setting environment variables

## Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

1. In your Railway project, go to the "Variables" tab
2. Add all your API keys and other environment variables:
   - SPORTRADAR_API_KEY
   - ESPN_API_KEY
   - STATS_PERFORM_API_KEY
   - WEATHER_API_KEY
   - SECRET_KEY (for Flask)
3. Click "Add" to save the variables

## Step 7: Initialize the Database Schema

After the first deployment completes:

1. Go to the "Deployments" tab in your Railway project
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Go to the "Shell" tab
4. Run the database initialization command:

```bash
python -c "from database.railway_db_config import get_db_connection, initialize_database; initialize_database(get_db_connection())"
```

## Step 8: Generate a Public Domain

1. In your Railway project, go to the "Settings" tab
2. Click "Generate Domain"
3. Railway will provide a public URL for your application

## Step 9: Set Up Continuous Deployment

Railway automatically sets up continuous deployment. Whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository:

1. Make changes to your local repository:

```bash
# Make changes to files
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

2. Railway will automatically detect the push and start a new deployment
3. You can monitor the deployment progress in the Railway dashboard

## Step 10: Managing Deployments

1. **View Deployment Logs**:
   - Go to the "Deployments" tab in your Railway project
   - Click on a deployment to view its logs

2. **Rollback to Previous Deployment**:
   - Go to the "Deployments" tab
   - Find the deployment you want to roll back to
   - Click the three dots menu and select "Redeploy"

3. **Configure Deployment Settings**:
   - Go to the "Settings" tab
   - You can configure auto-deployment settings, environment variables, and more

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment Fails**:
   - Check the deployment logs for error messages
   - Verify that all required dependencies are in requirements.txt
   - Ensure the Procfile is correctly configured

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify that the PostgreSQL service is properly linked to your application
   - Check that the environment variables are correctly set

3. **Application Crashes After Deployment**:
   - Check the logs for error messages
   - Verify that all environment variables are correctly set
   - Ensure the database schema has been initialized

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues, you can:
1. Check the Railway documentation: https://docs.railway.app/
2. Join the Railway Discord community: https://discord.gg/railway
3. Contact Railway support through their website

## Benefits of GitHub-Railway Integration

- **Continuous Deployment**: Changes are automatically deployed when you push to GitHub
- **Version Control**: All your code changes are tracked
- **Collaboration**: Easier for team members to contribute
- **Rollbacks**: You can easily revert to previous versions if needed
- **Branch Deployments**: You can set up Railway to deploy from specific branches for staging environments
